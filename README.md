# Curve-Fitting-Covid19
Using curve fitting method to predict when the covid-19 pandemic in Indonesia will end

The spread of Covid-19 has a huge impact on human life around the world, especially Indonesia. Until now, the estimation of when this pandemic will end is still a big question. Therefore, a prediction is needed as the basis for the policies of the interested parties. In this paper, the Curve Fitting method is used to estimate the period and total cases of the spread of Covid-19 based on time series data for positive case growth without considering the rate of recovery, lock down policy, and so on. With a method proposed and calculated based on a normal curve, it produces a prediction of when the pandemic will end.
